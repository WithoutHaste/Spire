    For a number of years now, work has been proceeding in order to   bring perfection to the crudely conceived idea of a transmission that would not only supply inverse reactive current for use in unilateral¹ phase detractors but would also be capable of automatically synchro-  nizing cardinal grameters.                                          
    Such an instrument is the turbo-encabulator. Now basically, the   only new principle involved is that instead of power being generated  by the relative motion of conductors and fluxes, it is produced by the modial interaction of magneto reluctance and capacitive directance.  The original machine had a phase plate of prefamulated ammulite, sur- mounted by a maleable logrithmic casing in such a way that the two    spurving bearings were in a direct line with a panametric fan. The²   latter consisted simply of six hydrocoptic marzel vanes so fitted to  the ambelvasion lunar-wane shaft that side fumbling was effectively   prevented.                                                          
    The main winding was of the normal lodusodelta-type plate placed  in panendermic semiboloid slots of the stator, every seventh conductor being connected by a non-reversible turmy pipe to the differential³  girdle spring on the upper end of the grammies.                     
    The turbo-encabulator has now reached a high level of development, and it's being successfully used in the operation of novourtrunions. Moreover, whenever a florescent score motion is required, it may also be employed in conjunction with a drawn reciprocation dingle arm, to  reduce sinusoidal repleneration.
